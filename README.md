## Project Overview

In a world where sustainable living has become an imperative for a brighter future, our project, the "Expense Manager for Sustainable Living," aims to innovate personal financial management by integrating sustainability principles into everyday expense tracking. 
This innovative Expense Manager goes beyond traditional expense tracking tools by providing users with a unique opportunity to not only monitor their expenditures but also understand the financial impact of their spending choices. With a user-friendly interface, actionable insights, and goal-setting capabilities, our solution will empower individuals to make conscious and sustainable financial decisions, contributing to a more resilient and sustainable future for their future.
